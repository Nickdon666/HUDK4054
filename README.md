# COMPARATIVE STUDY OF STRESS 

The University Student Mental Health Survey 2018 conducted across universities within the UK sheds light on the extensive prevalence of depression and anxiety among students, revealing a concerning pattern across all colleges. Hence, the focus of this research article lies in a comprehensive exploration of stress among college students in the UK.

## Description

Stress-related data was gathered for one sample population using validated instruments. The analysis employed multi-regression analysis, Principal Component Analysis clustering, and decision tree classifiers to unravel patterns within the data. This comparative analysis enhances the understanding of the complex dynamics of stress and coping mechanisms across diverse cultural and educational contexts.

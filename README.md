# COMPARATIVE STUDY OF STRESS 

The University Student Mental Health Survey 2018 conducted across universities within the UK sheds light on the extensive prevalence of depression and anxiety among students, revealing a concerning pattern across all colleges. Hence, the focus of this research article lies in a comprehensive exploration of stress among college students in the UK.

## Description

Stress-related data was gathered for one sample population using validated instruments. The analysis employed multi-regression analysis, Principal Component Analysis clustering, and decision tree classifiers to unravel patterns within the data. This comparative analysis enhances the understanding of the complex dynamics of stress and coping mechanisms across diverse cultural and educational contexts.

## Assignment details and reflection

- Metadata Standard: I chose the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) as the standard  metadata for this assignment. This decision was informed by DDI's broad acceptance, compatibility with diverse systems, and its capacity to offer thorough metadata descriptions for resources.
- Template: I downloaded this template from other Github repository. I found this one to be quite straightforward and easy to use, particularly as a beginner, to begin constructing the README file.
- Most Challenging Part: Just being honest, it took me a couple of hours to get started on this assignment, including watching tutorial videos, getting back to my previous projects, searching for suitable templates, etc. But the most challenging part of creating the README file was striking a balance between providing comprehensive information and keeping it concise and user-friendly. I wanted to ensure that users could quickly understand the project's purpose, how to use it, and how to contribute without overwhelming them with unnecessary details.
